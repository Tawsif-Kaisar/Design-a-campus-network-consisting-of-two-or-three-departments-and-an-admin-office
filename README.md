# Design-a-campus-network-consisting-of-two-departments-and-an-admin-office
Using Cisco Packet Tracer, we designed and simulated a secure and scalable campus network. The network focuses on two departments (e.g., ECE and CSE), and an Admin office. It includes dynamic routing for effective network communication, Access Control Lists (ACLs) to restrict access to administrative resources, password protection for network devices, DHCP for automatic IP address assignment, VLANs for departmental network segmentation, web and DNS servers for internal resource management, and dynamic routing for efficient network communication.
